This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(ggthemes)
a = fromJSON("mrc_biostats.json")
df=tibble(date=a[[1]],y=a[[2]])
df$date=lubridate::ymd(df$date)


df$label = "People infected"


b = read_csv("vaccinations.csv")
b$y=b$numFirstDose
b$date=lubridate::dmy(b$date)
b$label = "People vaccinated"


ggplot(bind_rows(df,b),aes(x=date,y=y/1000000,color=label))+geom_line(size=1) +labs(x="Date",y="Number of people (millions)",color="Type",title="Infection and vaccination levels in England",caption="Data sources: MRC Biostatistics Unit (cumulative infection estimates)\nOur World In Data & PHE (vaccination figures – at least one dose)")+theme_hc()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
